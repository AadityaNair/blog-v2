Both PulseAudio(*audio server*) and X server(*display*) have access controls enabled within it that does not allow anyone other
than the current logged in user to access its services. That means, by default, if you use a separate user (other than *root*)
to start a program, that program will not be able to create a GUI or make a sound.

This may not be ideal in various cases.

## Access control in X
This is pretty straight-forward. The program `xhost` manages the access controls for the server. To allow a user,
{% highlight shell %}
$ xhost +si:localuser:<username>
{% endhighlight %}

Or if you want to open X for all local users,
{% highlight shell %}
$ xhost +local:
{% endhighlight %}


## Access control in PulseAudio
For [security reasons], PulseAudio runs a separate instance for every
user rather than having a single systemwide instance for everyone. There is no simple access controls for PulseAudio.
Hence allowing audio for separate user is more of a workaround. What we do is ask PulseAudio to listen to a specific
local port and we ask the user to send audio to that port.

For the server configuration, edit `/etc/pulse/default.pa` to include the following line:
{% highlight shell %}
load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1
{% endhighlight %}

This makes PulseAudio listen on localhost for audio. Now edit `~/.config/pulse/client.conf` to have the following line
which makes it send audio to localhost
{% highlight shell %}
default-server = 127.0.0.1
{% endhighlight %}


And done. Now you can create UI and send audio as a separate user.
