/* These CSS configs are copied from the documentation of gatsby-remark-prismjs
   These can be left as is and will not need any manual editing in the future. Hopefully :-(

   The first CSS block does, something.
   The next two CSS blocks fix the case where long inline code doesn't wrap into the next line
   and causes a horizontal scroll. Added with their original comments.

   IMP: This currently does fuckall to help with the above problem. The classes below code targets
        doesn't actually apply to inline code.

/* IDK, why I added the below. The documentation mentioned something like, "If you want to 
   highlight lines of code, ....". Just check here if there is something suspect with highlighting.
   
   Also, this is very specific to solarized-light. Change to whatever theme you use later.
